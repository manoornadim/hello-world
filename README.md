# hello-world

Hi, my name is Manoor and I'm a Maths Undergraduate currently on my placement year working as a Data Science intern. I'm currently taking the Data Science Speiclization by John Hopkins University, and, by the end of the course, I'm hoping to have a solid foundation of knowledge that I can build on!
